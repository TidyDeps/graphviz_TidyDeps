# quoting Homebrew:
#
#   qt@5 is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /opt/homebrew,
#   because this is an alternate version of another formula.
#
#   If you need to have qt@5 first in your PATH, run:
#     echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/qt@5/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
#
#   For compilers to find qt@5 you may need to set:
#     export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/qt@5/lib"
#     export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/qt@5/include"
#
#   For pkg-config to find qt@5 you may need to set:
#     export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/qt@5/lib/pkgconfig"
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/qt@5/bin:$PATH"
